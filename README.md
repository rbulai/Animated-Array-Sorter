# Animated Array Sorter

This website visually sorts a randomly generated array. Using one of the implemented algorithms, the user can watch their generated array be sorted in real time, with color distinctions and an adjustable sorting speed slider to make watching the sorting process easier and more understandable. The user can also adjust the size of the array, which is also updated in real time so they can fine-tune the array to their liking.

This project is my own modified version of a school group project that I worked on.

<b>Important Note:</b> This website is not mobile friendly. Only laptop screens (1024px) or larger are supported.
